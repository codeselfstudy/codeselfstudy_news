## Notes

- The design should look neat, but be very minimalistic. No animation or fancy things.
- Eventually, it could be server-rendered or use a dynamic backend.
- Please format the code with Prettier.js. The general convention here is 4-space indentation and double-quotes.
- To get involved with development, talk to an organizer at a meetup. This project is beginner-friendly.
- Use React hooks instead of class-based components.
